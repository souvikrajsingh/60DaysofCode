# 60DaysofCode


This repository was earlier known as "100DaysofCode" , which was later changed to "60Daysofcode", due to continuous failing with the latter.


This repository is to document my progress with #60DaysofDSA challenge. This repository contains all the Codes and algorthims
I have been practising on daily basis. I am currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms with Java and soon will be starting with Development.
